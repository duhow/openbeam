# Agents Notes

## Commits

Use Conventional Commits in PR title. Common types are feat, fix, chore, refactor, perf, ci, docs.
If using scope, limit scope to two-word max, connected with dash.
Check historic commits to avoid making up new scopes every time.

## Development best practices

- Keep changes focused and minimal to the issue being solved.
- Reuse existing patterns and naming conventions in this codebase.
- Validate changes with available Gradle tasks before opening/merging (`fastlane/gradlew assembleDebug` at minimum).
- If touching UI text, keep user-facing wording clear and consistent.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.

## IMPORTANT: Layout changes

- `activity_share.xml` exists in **both**:
  - `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_share.xml` (portrait/default)
  - `app/src/main/res/layout-land/activity_share.xml` (landscape/horizontal)
- Any layout modification to this screen **must be applied in both files**.
- Treat portrait and landscape as a paired change to avoid regressions/crashes in horizontal mode.

## Changelogs

- Changelog files live in `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/`.
- Each release has a dedicated numbered file (e.g. `8.txt`) matching the versionCode for that release.
- **Edit the current numbered file** whenever you make user-facing changes (features, fixes, improvements).
- Keep entries concise and written from the user's perspective (e.g. `- Fixed crash when tapping a reset card`).
- Numbered files are permanent per-version snapshots — do **not** edit a file once its release tag has been created.

### Release flow (fully automatic)

1. Edit `<N>.txt` with all changes for the upcoming release.
2. Create the release tag in GitHub — the CI pipeline will automatically:
   - Read `<N>.txt` and use it as the GitHub Release description.
   - Commit a new `<N+1>.txt` placeholder to `main` for the next release.
3. Edit the newly created `<N+1>.txt` for the next release cycle.
